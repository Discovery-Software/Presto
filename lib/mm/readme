Copyright 2010-2011 Bruce Alderson



Installation and setup:

1. Place the files into your web root (any location works).  Example

	js/mm.js
	api/mm.php

2. Add the <form> to your website template, using the example in example-1.html 
   and example-2.html. Everything in <div id="contact"> is required, as well as the
   script hooks.  See 'Script hooks' for details on adding the scripting poriton.
      
3. Add your styles (or customize the styles in mm.css) to fit your theme.  See 
   'Style notes' for details.

4. Configure your mm.php settings:

	$website = 'napkinware.com'; 		// your website
	$sender = 'bruce@napkinware.com'; 	// your email address
	$to 	= $sender; 
	
	
	
Style notes
-----------


1. Errors are indicated by adding a .error class to input fields that are not correct.  You can customize this style in a number of ways:

* Custom backgroun colour
* Custom error text (using CSS :before or :after)

2. Send errors and thank-yous are styled using the following:

* #mm-thanks, #mm-error (the background)
* #mm-thanks>div, #mm-error>div	(the content)

These errors and thank-yous can be shown as popups or inline with the existing form.

To display as a popup:

* Set background to position: fixed, and the inner content to a styled window (position: absolute, border background, centered, etc.)

To display inline:

* Don't set any fixed or absolute positions
					
			
	
Script hooks
------------

The mm script validates the fields, posts the form, and shows error/thank-you 
messages.  To include the script, add the following between the </body> and </html> tags:


<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.1/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="mm.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">

$(document).ready(	
	function (e) {

		mm.init(); // start up the mailer form
		
	}
);
</script>
